## 🧱 Suggested Video Structure
[Intro]
Hook Idea:
“Want to install Arch Linux with full disk encryption, Btrfs subvolumes, and a minimal Hyprland setup?
In this video, I’ll walk through my personal setup - from disk wiping to graphical desktop, without the use of archinstall script!”

# 🎥 Chapters
[0. A brief overview of what’s covered]
1. Download and add the image to a flash drive with Ventoy
1. Conecting to WIFI
1. Disk setup
1. Base system installation
1. Configuration before first boot
1. Bootloader + Encryption Integration
1. First boot
1. Desktop Environment + Hyprland
1. GRUB & bootloader encryption
1. Mention you’ll share the steps in detail (with config tips)

[1. Preparing the Install]
ISO download and Ventoy

## 🎬 Visual Tips:
Screen capture Ventoy install procedure on Linux, and tell it works on Windows as well.

Optional: overlay the commands as you type

[3. Disk Setup]
Disk formatting with secure wipe (nvme format + dd)
Partitioning (EFI + LUKS using gdisk)
Encryption setup with cryptsetup
Formatting and mounting Btrfs with subvolumes

## 🎬 Visual Tips:
Add a diagram to show the partition/subvolume layout
Mention why subvolumes are useful (snapshots, flexibility)

[4. Base System Installation]
Reflector to get fast mirrors
pacstrap for base system
genfstab for mounting

## 🎬 Visual Tips:
Fast-forward parts like long install output
Zoom in on terminal for key steps

[5. Configuration before first boot]
Chroot into system
Install useful base packages
Add user, enable sudo
Timezone, hostname, password setup

## 🎬 Visual Tips:
Show editing /etc/hostname, /etc/sudoers with nvim
Talk about enabling only essential services

[6. Bootloader + Encryption Integration]
Create LUKS keyfile for automatic unlock
Edit mkinitcpio.conf and grub config
Add FILES=(...) to mkinitcpio
Install GRUB, rebuild initramfs, setup boot entries

## 🎬 Visual Tips:
Explain GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX briefly
Mention why you’re using keyfile and cryptodisk

[7. First Boot]
Show boot process
Login as new user
Connect to Wi-Fi via nmcli

## 🎬 Visual Tips:
Do a real-time login demo
Show successful desktop boot

[8. Desktop Environment + Hyprland]
Install GNOME, Hyprland, Alacritty, etc.
Enable GDM and auto-start graphical UI

## 🎬 Visual Tips:
Brief Hyprland overview (why you use it)
Show your actual running system - terminal + window manager in action
Add neofetch output to show installed system

[9. hyprland configuration]
Initial generation of the hyprland configuration file by logging in,
and logging out and into gnome to edit the hyprland.conf file in alacritty with nvim. 

[10. Outro + Tips]
Share any dotfiles or links in the description
Tips for customizing Hyprland, using Wayland, and tools you like
Mention you’ll cover dotfile/config setup in a future video?

## 🎙️ Script Notes (optional tone suggestions):
Be authentic. Share why you chose this setup.
If something was tricky (e.g. GRUB encryption), talk about it honestly.
Include your own tweaks or preferences — that makes it personal.

## 📁 Bonus Tip:
Put your entire Markdown file in the description or a GitHub repo, and link it in the video with a voiceover like:
“All the commands I used in this video are in the description below or on GitHub if you want to follow along.”

## 🛠️ Tools You Might Want to Use
Kdenlive, DaVinci Resolve, or OBS Studio for screen capture and editing
Simple terminal font (Hack, JetBrains Mono, etc.)
Clear mic for narration
